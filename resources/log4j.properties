# There are three separate logs:
#
#     soapXmlLogger: Logs the complete SOAP requests and responses.
#     requestInfoLogger: Logs basic information on what SOAP requests were made.
#     report_download: Logs report download requests and response headers.
#
# By default, the request_info log will store information on all requests while
# the soap_xml log will log only errors.
#
# Author: Kevin Winter

# Point each log to its appender. The first word after the equals sign
# represents the level of logging for each log. For example, to change the
# soapXmlLogger to only log all SOAP interactions, change the word WARN to
# INFO.
